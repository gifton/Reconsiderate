# Reconsiderate
A Rethinking of the application Rethought.  Written with swift 5
Recinsiderate is an application designed to help record and keep track of your thoughts.  Adding "sparqs" in the form of images, text, links,  and audio recordings (more in the works!).  Written with Swift 5, Reconsiderate takes advantage of a few cocoa pods, and the MVVM application structure. 


> Reconsiderate uses MVVM, and core data to present thoughts.  Thought entities have a subentity called Entry, that can be text, an image, a link or an audio recording.
> Reconsiderate saves all data on device with the intention of using coreML to create custom experiances fro users later on without the need for network tasks or servers.

## Instilation requirements 
> Requirements:  [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) and [xcode](https://apple.com/developer)
* Clone repo
* cd into the directory you saved the project
* run `pod install` to install dependancies

Happy thinking!
